# Improving Public Transportation

Our group is primarily concerned with the issues of transportation in the city
of Seattle. With the city growing at an alarming rate, there are inevitably
more and more people on the roads traveling each day. We look at the Puget
Sound Regional Council's Travel Survey results from 2014 to understand the
travel modes and trends of Seattle residents. Data can be found here:
https://www.psrc.org/household-travel-survey-program

The insights from the PSRC Travel Survey will be cross-referenced with Seattle
public transit data to understand how well the current systems accommodate the
needs of Seattle residents. A similar map to Figure 1 of King County transit
routes will be overlaid with 'hot-spots' of travel destinations from the PSRC
data.

Once we better understand how well the current public transportation system
aligns with the needs of the city, we can then make suggestions as to how it
might be improved. This could involve additional bus lines being added, new
link stations erected in the future, etc. Just as well, we are interested in
how socioeconomic status determines modes and trends of transportation
throughout Seattle.
